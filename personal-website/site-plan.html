        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            My education is something really important in my life. Learning makes part of me, and I love to be always
            learning.
            I enjoyed learning languages, I speak Spanish, English, Portugese, French and Italian, and it fulfills me,
            when I understand more of them.
            Same thing happens to me when talking about technology. I have been studying by myself to become a
            Full-Stack developer, but first,
            starting as a Front-End Dev. I learned by seeking online courses, technologies, such as HTML, CSS,
            Javascript, and React.

            In college, I have learned a lot about logic, advanced algebra, Java, SQL and databases logic in general. I
            really love to learn
            and that's why I'm doing a separated page dedicated to the places that taught me and the skills I've been
            learning.
